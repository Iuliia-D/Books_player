# Books_player

Website for easy listening to audiobooks for my grandma.
The site uses the playerjs.com player with a memory function, so you can continue listening to the audiobook even after reloading the page or logging out of your account.
To do this, you must first register and log in.
Only audiobooks uploaded to the hosting are available for listening.
The range of books and the style of literature are determined by the tastes of my grandmother.
Also added one author of my choice (guess which one).
